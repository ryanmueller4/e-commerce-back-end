# E-commerce Back End Starter Code

## Description

This is the code for the back end of an e-commerce website. It utilizes JavaScript, Express, mysql, and Sequelize to create a database with API routes to make HTTP requests.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Due to the fact that the code only contains a back end, use a REST client like Insomnia to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to access information in the database.
